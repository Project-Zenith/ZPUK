# Development Has Ceased  
I haven't touched this in months due to a lack of interest in unity  
I will leave this a public archive for now. 

# IMPORT PANELS NONFUNCTIONAL  
Yes I am very aware of this issue, I have yet to fix it as I do not have asset hosting currently.  

# Zenith Unity Kit  
The Zenith Unity Kit is a new project designed to bring together anything you may need in Unity3D.  
We have no target production for what you can use, as our target IS the Unity3D Engine.  
There is no Discord Server for Zenith, Everything will be on the GitHub Repository.

# License

**This repository assumes MIT as it is unmaintained**  
Do as you want, I almost never use unity anymore  
No reason for me to restrict control when I don't even bother with this  
Be careful of where you download forks/modifications from  
I can't save you if you got a copy infected with something
