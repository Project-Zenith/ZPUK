# FAQ

> The Import Panels don't work!  
- Yes I am aware of this, I do not have a hosting solution for the assets currently, They will work when I do have a way.    

> I just updated and im getting errors!  
- Delete the old version and then import the new version, This is probably because of file structure changes.  

> Could I be banned from x platform for using this?  
- If they are to ban anyone for using Zenith Unity Kit then it is an unjustified ban as we do not modify anything.  

> My avatar won't upload! There's an error.  
- I don't handle these issues, Please solve this with the support team to the platform you are trying to upload to.  

> What can Zenith do?  
- It is a full set of Unity Scripts and Utilities to make creating content smoother.  

> Why does it take so long to import?  
- There are many DLLs and Scripts; Unity executes them in the editor, so they are compiled during import.  

> Why are you making this now?  
- I have come to finally have a way to bring back my work safely.  

> Why does it not import?  
- Unity sometimes doesn't have the correct permissions it needs to import assets, try and restart Unity, your PC, or create a new project.  

> Uploading gives me an error  
- Again this is not my fault or my issue, You must sort this issue out with the platform themself.  

> The Unity Kit won't load even when imported!  
- Look for compile errors in the console; they prevent Unity from loading Scripts and DLLs, also check for missing Scripts and DLLs by reimporting the package.

- Of course; You can open a GitHub issue to request your assets to be removed, explain to me which assets are involved, and we'll sort it out.  

> Are you logging my information?  
- No, There is nothing to log.
